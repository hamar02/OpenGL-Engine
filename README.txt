This is a x84 project, so change that before hitting build.
Then I've implemented:
Normal Maps
Deffered Rendering
Physically Based Rendering
Shadow Mapping for directional light, it's static
HDR
Bloom in compute shader
Frustum Culling in compute shader, the red lines in the editor window is the frustum of the camera in the game engine window

The bbox for the planes are the same as the cube so that why it's popping
